      The <strong>Grand Coven Library</strong> is a solo role-playing game
      designed and published by Scott Russell Morris, aka Magpie Zines. In order
      to add a book to the library, you will need a copy of the game. Physical
      copies may be purchased from the

    <h2>Information for Librarians</h2>
    <p>
      Once you’ve entered a new book into the library catalog, it will be
      publicly displayed to anyone who searches the library. If you’ve added a
      book and would prefer it not be listed, please use the contact form below
      and we will remove it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grand Coven Library celebrates diversity and inclusion in our titles.
      We actively welcome books that represent a spectrum of identities. Entries
      that promote — or appear to promote — homophobia, sexism, racism, ageism,
      transphobia, or other harmful ideologies will be removed.

  <section class="call-numbers">
    <h2>How Call Numbers Are Generated</h2>
    <p>
      Every call number in the Grand Coven Library is unique. The first glyphs
      are based on the <strong>magic category</strong> and the
      <strong>book class</strong>. A numeric ID is assigned based on the total
      number of entries, and final letters come from the author’s last name (or
      book title initials for anonymous works).
    </p>
    <p>Each magic category uses a different occult alphabet:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dark Magic</strong> — Alphabet of the Magi</li>
      <li><strong>Folk Magic</strong> — Theban</li>
      <li><strong>Nature Magic</strong> — Runes</li>
      <li><strong>Elder Magic</strong> — Malachim’s Alphabet</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These call numbers become summoning glyphs. Inscribe them in the air with
      a Grand Coven Library Circulation Wand (patent pending), and the book will
      appear.
